# email_process

basic email processing fishes out timestamps.

# Brian! 

you should be able to start the virtualenvironment from within this dir with the following command:
`source /venv/bin/activate`
once that is up and running to exit use:
`deactivate`
to process an email you will need to point to a .eml file.  If you drag an email to your desktop it will show the file as the subject line for example the email you send me is `EDL stuffs.`  An example command would be (again from this dir)   
`./email_process.py -m /path/to/desktop/EDL\ stuffs..eml`
